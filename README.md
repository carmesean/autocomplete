# autocomplete
An autocomplete program that automatically gives suggestions (e.g. google search bar) using the trie data structure. 
The skeleton for the 5 files were given to us as a class assignment, and we were tasked with completing the TrieAutocomplete class. 
To see my contributions, view the code underneath that class.
